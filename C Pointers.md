# C pointers

One of the most powerful features of the C programming language is **pointer**.

## Pointer Variable Definitions and Initialization

Pointers are variables whose values are *memory addresses*. Normally, a variable directly contains a specific value. A pointer, however, contains an address of a variable that contains a specific value. In this sense, a variable name directly references a value, and a pointer indirectly references a value. Refrencing a value through a pointer is called indirection.
